# Task 01 – Caesar Cipher

This is a Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher technique.

## 🔐 How it Works:
- User enters a message, a shift value, and chooses `encrypt` or `decrypt`
- Each letter is shifted forward or backward by the key
- The result is displayed in the terminal

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
